# Platform-independent secure storage model

This module defines a plug and play model for credential stores.
The model comprises two traits: [CredentialStoreApi] for
store-level operations
and [CredentialApi] for
entry-level operations.  These traits must be implemented
in a thread-safe way, a requirement captured in the [CredentialStore] and
[Credential] types that wrap them.
