# Keyring-core

This crate provides a cross-platform library that supports storage and retrieval
of passwords (or other secrets) in a variety of secure credential stores.
Please see
[this document](https://github.com/open-source-cooperative/keyring-rs/wiki/Keyring)
for an introduction to the keyring ecosystem and
[this document](https://github.com/open-source-cooperative/keyring-rs/wiki/Keyring-Core)
for a comprehensive treatment of this crate's APIs.

This crate provides two cross-platform credential stores. These
are provided to support client testing and as a guide for developers who
would like to build keyring-compatible credential store modules. The
stores in this crate are explicitly _not_ warranted to be either secure or robust.
See the [mock] and [sample] modules for details. (Note: the [sample]
module is only built if the `sample` feature is specified.)

## Thread Safety

While this crate's code is thread-safe,
and requires credential store objects
to be both Send and Sync, the underlying credential
stores may not handle access to a single credential
from different threads reliably.
See the documentation of each credential store for details.
