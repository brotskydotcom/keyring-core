# Contributors

This library has a long history. It was first written by [Walther Chen](https://github.com/hwchen) as a "library plus
credential store" combination and published as the [keyring](https://crates.io/crates/keyring) crate. That crate,
currently maintained by [Dan Brotsky](https://github.com/brotskydotcom), has now evolved to be a keyring-core CLI
application and compendium of compatible credential stores.

All of the contributors listed here are listed by their GitHub monikers, with an `@` in front. The direct link for

If you should be listed in this file, but don't find yourself, please contact @brotskydotcom.
